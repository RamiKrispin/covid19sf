<p>The <strong>covid19sf</strong> package provides two datasets focusing on the overall hospital capacity and patients status in San Francisco hospitals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>covid19sf_hospital</code> - a daily snapshot of the hospital capacity</li>

<code>covid19sf_hospitalizations</code> - a daily snapshot of the patients status</li>

<p>The <code>covid19sf_hospital</code> dataset provides a daily snapshot of the San Francisco hospital capacity by bed type and status with the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>bed_type</code> - number of hospital beds available by department type:
<ul>
<li>Acute Care</li>
<li>Intensive Care</li>
<li>Acute Care Surge</li>
<li>Intensive Care Surge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>status</code> - the department corresponding bed status:
<ul>
<li>Available</li>
<li>COVID-19 (Confirmed &amp; Suspected)</li>
<li>Other Patients</li>
</ul>
