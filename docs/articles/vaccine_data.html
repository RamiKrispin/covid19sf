<p>The covid19sf_vaccine_demo and covid19sf_vaccine_demo_ts datasets provide demographics information on the San Francisco vaccination effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>covid19sf_vaccine_demo</code> - Summary of vaccine doses given to San Franciscans by demographics groups (age and race)</li>

<code>covid19sf_vaccine_demo_ts</code> - Time series view of vaccine doses given to San Franciscans by demographics groups (age and race)</li>

<p>The <code>covid19sf_vaccine_demo</code> summarizes the COVID-19 vaccine doses given to San Franciscans by demographics (age and race groups) and includes the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>overall_segment</code> - Segment (universe) of analysis. Unique combination of administering_provider_type, age_group, and demographic_group. Filter to a single option to derive meaningful totals.</li>
<li>
<code>administering_provider_type</code> - Providers included in a given overall_segment. Two possible values: ‘All’ (including SF DPH) or ‘DPH Only’</li>
<li>
<code>age_group</code> - Age range included in a given overall_segment</li>
<li>
<code>demographic_group</code> - Type of demographic group included in a given overall_segment (e.g. Age, Race/Ethnicity)</li>
<li>
<code>demographic_subgroup</code> - Specific demographic group counted in a given record (e.g. 16-24, Asian)</li>
<li>
<code>demographic_subgroup_sort_order</code> - Numeric sort order for all demographic_subgroups. Convenient for maintaining consistent ordering across multiple data visualizations.</li>
<li>
<code>total_1st_doses</code> - Total number of first doses administered</li>
<li>
<code>total_2nd_doses</code> - Total number of second doses administered</li>
<li>
<code>total_single_doses</code> - Total number of single dose vaccines administered</li>
<li>
<code>total_recipients</code> - Total number of unique vaccine recipients</li>
<li>
<code>total_series_completed</code> - Total number of individuals fully vaccinated (those having received the second dose of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine)</li>
<li>
<code>subgroup_population</code> - 2018 5-year American Community Survey population estimates for given demographic_subgroup</li>
<li>
<code>age_group_population</code> - 2018 5-year American Community Survey population estimates for overall age_group<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>data_as_of</code> - Timestamp for last update date in source system</li>

<p>Using this dataset, we can answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the proportion of San Francisco population that got vaccinated?</li>
<li>How many people got two doses of the vaccine (e.g., Pfizer or Moderna) vs single dose (J&amp;J)?</li>
<li>What is the distribution of the vaccine doses given to San Franciscans by demographics groups (age and race)?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the following example, we will explore the distribution of San Francisco population by age group. Let’s start by filtering the data by all providers and age group demographics:</p>

<p>Next, we will sort the data by age group and convert the <code>demographic_subgroup</code> into an ordered factor:</p>

<p>Let’s start by plotting the distribution of San Francisco vaccinated population using the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Two Doses</strong> - San Franciscans who received the two doses of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine</li>
<li>
<strong>Single Dose</strong> - San Franciscans who received the J&amp;J single-dose vaccine</li>
<li>
<strong>First Dose</strong> - San Franciscans who received the first dose out of two of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine</li>
<li>
<strong>Not Vaccinated</strong> - San Franciscans who did not receive any COVID-19 vaccine</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the <code>total_2nd_doses</code> variable (received the second dose) is a subset of <code>total_1st_doses</code> (received only the first out of two doses), we will have to exclude it:</p>

<p>The <code>covid19sf_vaccine_demo_ts</code> dataset is a time series format of the <code>covid19sf_vaccine_demo</code> dataset, and includes the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>date_administered</code> - Date vaccination administered</li>
<li>
<code>overall_segment</code> -Segment (universe) of analysis. Unique combination of administering_provider_type, age_group, and demographic_group. Filter to a single option to derive meaningful totals.</li>
<li>
<code>administering_provider_type</code> - Providers included in a given overall_segment. Two possible values: ‘All’ (including SF DPH) or ‘DPH Only’</li>
<li>
<code>age_group</code> - Age range included in a given overall_segment</li>
<li>
<code>demographic_group</code> - Type of demographic group included in a given overall_segment (e.g. Age, Race/Ethnicity)</li>
<li>
<code>demographic_subgroup</code> - Specific demographic group counted in a given record (e.g. 16-24, Asian)</li>
<li>
<code>demographic_subgroup_sort_order</code> - Numeric sort order for all demographic_subgroup. Convenient for maintaining consistent ordering across multiple data visualizations.</li>
<li>
<code>new_1st_doses</code> - Count of 1st doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete</li>
<li>
<code>new_2nd_doses</code> - Count of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete</li>
<li>
<code>new_single_doses</code> - Count of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete</li>
<li>
<code>new_series_completed</code> - Count of individuals newly fully vaccinated on a given day (given the 2nd dose of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single dose vaccine)</li>
<li>
<code>new_recipients</code> - Count of individuals vaccinated (with any dose) for the first time according to CA’s records</li>
<li>
<code>cumulative_1st_doses</code> - Cumulative total of 1st doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete</li>
<li>
<code>cumulative_2nd_doses</code> - Cumulative total of 2nd doses administered for vaccines that take two doses to complete</li>
<li>
<code>cumulative_single_doses</code> - Cumulative total of doses administered for vaccines that take one dose to complete</li>
<li>
<code>cumulative_series_completed</code> - Cumulative total individuals fully vaccinated (given the 2nd dose of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a single dose vaccine)</li>
<li>
<code>cumulative_recipients</code> - Cumulative total individuals vaccinated (with any dose) according to CA’s records</li>
<li>
<code>subgroup_population</code> - American Community Survey population estimates for given demographic_subgroup</li>
<li>
<code>age_group_population</code> - American Community Survey population estimates for overall age_group</li>
<li>
<code>data_as_of</code> - Timestamp for last update date in source system</li>
<li>
<code>data_loaded_at</code> - Timestamp when the record (row) was most recently updated here in the Open Data Portal</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s load and review the dataset:</p>
