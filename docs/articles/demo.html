<p>The <strong>covid19sf</strong> package provides several datasets that descrive the distribution of cases in the city by demographic group (age, race, gender, homelessness, etc.). That includes the following datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>covid19sf_age</code> - Cases summarized by age group</li>
<li>
<code>covid19sf_demo</code> - Cases summarized by date, transmission and case disposition</li>
<li>
<code>covid19sf_gender</code> - Confirmed cases summarized by gender</li>
<li>
<code>covid19sf_homeless</code> - Confirmed cases by homelessness</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All datasets above are not normalized by the proportion of the overall population of San Francisco (or any other normalization method). Therefore, it hard to conclude on any of the demographic groups (age, gender, race, etc.) without having additional information about San Francisco’s overall demographic distribution. In addition, unfortunately, the datasets do not have a unique key. Therefore, it is not possible to make an inner join between different demographic measurements (e.g., age and gender).</p>
<div id="age-group" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#age-group" class="anchor"></a>Age group</h3>
<p>The <code>covid19sf_age</code> dataset provides distribution of new and aggregate cases by age group. That includes the following age groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under 18</li>
<li>18 to 30</li>
<li>31 to 40</li>
<li>41 to 50</li>
<li>51 to 60</li>
<li>61 to 70</li>
<li>71 to 80</li>
<li>81 and above</li>

<p>In the following example, we will use the <a href="https://plotly.com/r/">plotly</a> package to visualize the daily new cases distributions by age group. First, let’s sort the age group:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit">
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="kw"><a href="https://plotly-r.com">plotly</a></span>)

                                  levels = <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="st">"under 18"</span>,  <span class="st">"18-30"</span>, 
                                             <span class="st">"31-40"</span>, <span class="st">"41-50"</span>,
                                             <span class="st">"51-60"</span>, <span class="st">"61-70"</span>,
                                             <span class="st">"71-80"</span>,<span class="st">"81+"</span>))
</pre></div>
<p>Next, we will use the <code>box</code> plot option to create a box-plot by age group:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit">
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/plot_ly.html">plot_ly</a></span>(<span class="kw">covid19sf_age</span>,

        y = <span class="op">~</span> <span class="kw">new_confirmed_cases</span>, 
        boxpoints = <span class="st">"all"</span>, 
        jitter = <span class="fl">0.3</span>,
        pointpos = <span class="op">-</span><span class="fl">1.8</span>,
        type = <span class="st">"box"</span> ) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/plotly/man/layout.html">layout</a></span>(title = <span class="st">"Case Dist. by Age Group"</span>,
       yaxis = <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list</a></span>(title = <span class="st">"Number of Cases"</span>),
       xaxis = <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list</a></span>(title = <span class="st">"Source: San Francisco Department of Public Health"</span>),
       legend = <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list</a></span>(x = <span class="fl">0.9</span>, y = <span class="fl">0.9</span>))
